# Web-page-change-monitor
**A simple python script to easily monitor the changes to a webpage every time it is run**

Background - I had to monitor a web page once a day for any update at work, but the ready to made solutions available online cost money.
The pythons scripts that I could find by a simple google search needed the script to be running constantly. Therefore, I wrote this code.
You can close this script and the next time you run it you will be track changes compared to the first time.
