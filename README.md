# Web-page-change-monitor
**A simple python script to easily monitor the changes to a webpage every time it is run**

Background - I had to monitor a web page once a day for any update at work. However, the ready to made solutions available online cost money.
Furthermore, the pythons scripts that I could find by a simple google search needed the script to be running constantly. Therefore, I decided to write this code.
You can close this script and the next time you run it, you will be able to see if any changes have been made to the website being monitored.
